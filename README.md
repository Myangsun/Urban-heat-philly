# Project Title
Urban Heat Vulunerability Shinny App
As urbanization accelerates and climate change intensifies, extreme heat events pose a growing challenge for cities like Philadelphia. Vulnerable populations, such as low-income households, seniors, and children, are disproportionately affected by heat-related risks. This application seeks to visualize and analyze the changes in urban heat vulnerability from 2000 to 2020, enabling policymakers and stakeholders to prioritize effective interventions.

This project uses a multi-layered approach to quantify and map heat vulnerability:

Heat Exposure Score: Calculated from temperature anomalies and spatial distribution.
Socioeconomic Vulnerability Score: Weighted composite score combining demographic and economic factors.
Heat Vulnerability Score: A combined metric identifying neighborhoods with the highest risk due to overlapping environmental and socioeconomic vulnerabilities.
Interactive maps and neighborhood-level details provide actionable insights for urban planners, policymakers, and community organizations.
